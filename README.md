# IMC Technical Assessment

Two files corresponding to two different assessments.

## Usage

Highly recommand using docker and mapping the repo to the container.
You can use gcc's official docker image

```bash
docker pull gcc
```
Then mount the repo to the container and run as following instructions.

Both projects are implemented using CMake. 

```bash
cd visitor/build
cd rps_game/build
```
After getting into the root paths of both projects respectively
```bash
cmake ..
```
Then if you want to check the tests, you can go into the /test folder and run
```
./unit_tests
```
Else, if you want to run the project, you can see the executable file under your current path (which is the {$PROJECT_ROOT}/build folder)

## Explaination

### Visitor

Using visitor pattern plus Google test doing some simple unit tests
Will feature type generatlization if I got time and patient

### RPS game

Using factory pattern dynamically creating Rock, Paper and Scissor by using as less memory as possible. (Tho, I don't think it is necessary, but anyway, this is a technical interview, so ...)

Using observer pattern to record the game history.

Using strategy pattern to decouple strategy and data.
